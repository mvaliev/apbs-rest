## Overview
APBS-REST serves as the beginning effort to rebuild the infrastructure powering the [APBS-PDB2PQR](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr) software suite.  One of the goals with the redesign is to eliminate the OS-specific idiosyncrasies/inconsistencies one must account for during development.  While the main software undergoes its own overhaul, the services herein will become a deployment mechanism by which to execute APBS or PDB2PQR.  Facilitating the development/deployment are the containerization engine [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), the container-orchestration software [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and the Kubernetes package manager [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

Products of this effort include a new user interface alongside [command line tools](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-rest/tree/master/cli) to interact with the service.

### What is Docker?
<!-- From [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started): -->
From [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker):
>Docker containers wrap up software and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development that includes everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools and libraries.

An easy way to understand containers are as lightweight, ephemeral virtual machines, while Docker is the engine which powers them.  As such, it allows for isolated, consistent execution across operating systems without dealing with the variances of any individual's environment.

### What is Kubernetes?
Since the main components of APBS-REST are containerized elements, Kubernetes is utilized to serve as the orchestrator glueing each service together. From [Kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/):
>Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

Depending on your platform, there exist a couple installation methods: **Minikube** or **Docker Desktop**

### What is Helm?
Configuring and deploying each microservice for a cluster can be a tedious procedure. Ameliorating this process is Helm, a tool for packaging container-based applications. From [Helm](https://helm.sh/):
>Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

Advertising itself as "The package manager for Kubernetes", Helm, in concept, functions similarly to other popular package managers such as *pip* for Python, *apt*/*yum* for Linux, or *Homebrew* for macOS.

<!-- ### What is Minikube? -->


<!-- ## System Requirements -->
<!-- ## Prerequisites
### Users
To run the suite as a user, the following software must be installed/activated:
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) 
- A Kubernetes engine such as...
    - [Minikube (recommended for Linux users, available on Windows)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
    - [Docker Desktop (includes Kubernetes)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)<br/>
    *Windows 10 Users: Docker Desktop uses Hyper-V for virtualization. This is only available for users of Windows 10 Pro or above (Enterprise, Education, etc.)*

**Additional guidance for potential roadblocks coming soon.**<br/><br/>
    
### Developers
All of the above along with...
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)
    - for development on services using legacy PDB2PQR code
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
    - Certain tests require this as they utilize the [Docker SDK for Python](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) -->

## Install
### Prerequisites

Before installing APBS-REST, the following must be installed in order on your device:
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
- [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)
   - These instructions are for Helm 3, which introduced significant changes to its command line interface
   - Instructions for Helm versions &gt;2.15 and &lt;3.x can be found in an [earlier version of this document](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-rest/blob/56bb2bf9412918139146f4c2887b75b289dc61a4/README.md).

The commands ```kubectl``` and ```helm``` should how be available. Verify your Minikube and Helm installations on your preferred command line:
```
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16", GitVersion:"v1.16.2", GitCommit:"c97fe5036ef3df2967d086711e6c0c405941e14b", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-10-15T19:18:23Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.10", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16", GitVersion:"v1.16.0", GitCommit:"2bd9643cee5b3b3a5ecbd3af49d09018f0773c77", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-09-18T14:27:17Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

$ helm version
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.15.2", GitCommit:"8dce272473e5f2a7bf58ce79bb5c3691db54c96b", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.15.2", GitCommit:"8dce272473e5f2a7bf58ce79bb5c3691db54c96b", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```

**Note for Docker Desktop users:** If you already use the latest versions of Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac, Kubernetes is bundled and ready to be enabled via the Settings menu.  However, Docker Desktop for Windows requires Hyper-V, which users not on Windows 10 Professional or higher cannot access.  This is why we target Minikube for user installation of APBS-REST, as VirtualBox is available to anyone with a virtualization-compatible processor (most Intel/AMD CPUs over the past decade should have this feature).

Please note that the Kubernetes version bundled with Docker Desktop **generally lags behind (1.14.7 compared to current 1.16.2 as of this writing)** and may exhibit potential incompatibilities in the future.  If you do plan to use Docker Desktop with it's Kubernetes, the current version (v2.1.0.4) has proven compatible during development thus far.

### Known Installation Issues
- Helm versions < 2.15 will will not install with Kubernetes v1.16
- Helm version 3.0 makes significant changes to the command line interface. This README ~~will be~~ has been updated to reflect this.
- During initial testing, issues were encountered when attempting to start Minikube with Hyper-V as the driver.  Your mileage may vary, but VirtualBox has yet to exhibit any issues while launching Minikube (fingers crossed).
    - [UPDATE] It seems recent versions of Minikube show improved compatibility with Windows Hyper-V, so going the Minikube route should be safe should you need Hyper-V for something else (such as Docker Desktop)

Any additional issues discovered will be noted here.

### APBS-REST Installation
Firstly, clone/download this repository. The files needed to define the orchestration are contained within.  Navigate into the top directory of the repository:
```shell
cd apbs-rest/
```


#### After cloning of the repository
<!-- If you've never used Helm or don't have its Tiller installed on your cluster, do the following:
```shell
kubectl create serviceaccount tiller --namespace kube-system
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-rule --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
helm init --service-account=tiller --wait
```
This installs the server-side component necessary for Helm to operate.
<br> -->

Enable an ingress controller for your Minikube cluster. 
```shell
minikube addons enable ingress
```
- **Docker Desktop:** Add the stable repo to helm then ```helm install``` an NGINX ingress controller since you don't have access to Minikube. Be mindful that the ```nginx-ingress``` **consumes the localhost ports 80 and 443.**
    ```shell
    helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
    helm install nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system
    ```
An ingress object manages/defines how external network access to services within the cluster is routed, and the ingress controller does the work of routing the traffic.

#### Create an APBS namespace
Create a namespace for APBS-REST (examples will use the ```apbs``` namespace) to separate its resources from anything else you may install in the cluster:
```shell
kubectl create namespace apbs
```

<!-- <br> -->
#### Using Helm to install APBS-REST
Finally, ```helm install``` APBS-REST onto your cluster:
<!-- ```shell
helm install charts/apbs-rest -n apbs-rest --set ingress.enabled=true,ingress.hosts[0]=apbs.$(minikube ip).xip.io
``` -->
```shell
helm install apbs-rest charts/apbs-rest \
--namespace apbs \
--set ingress.enabled=true,ingress.hosts[0]=apbs.$(minikube ip).xip.io
```
- **Docker Desktop:** this step differs in that you'd use the localhost IP address.
    <!-- ```shell
    helm install charts/apbs-rest -n apbs-rest --set ingress.enabled=true,ingress.hosts[0]=apbs.127.0.0.1.xip.io
    ``` -->
    ```shell
    helm install apbs-rest charts/apbs-rest \
    --namespace apbs \
    --set ingress.enabled=true,ingress.hosts[0]=apbs.127.0.0.1.xip.io
    ```
The cluster will begin downloading the necessary images and readying the application.  Walk away and grab a coffee, because this step can take upwards of ~6 minutes (+/- based on your network speeds).  Review the arguments via ```helm install --help``` if you wish to understand the flags used above.

If you'd like to view the installation status, execute the following:
<!-- ```shell
helm status apbs-rest
``` -->
```shell
kubectl get deployments --namespace apbs
```
The output here shows which components of APBS-REST are ready for use, indicated by ```0/1``` or ```1/1``` under the ```READY``` column.
```
$ kubectl get deployments --namespace apbs
NAME                  READY  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  AGE
apbs-rest-autofill    1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-id          1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-minio       1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-storage     1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-task        1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-tesk        1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-tesk-proxy  1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-ui          1/1    1           1          10m
apbs-rest-workflow    1/1    1           1          10m
```
When you see all deployments in the READY state, you're good to go.

#### Access GUI via Browser
Find the host if you forgot the one defined at the ```helm install``` step:
```shell
kubectl get ing --namespace apbs
```
Under the ```HOSTS``` column, the hostname you defined earlier will show. Use your browser to navigate to there and enjoy!

#### Uninstall
There's more regarding the uninstalling process [below](#uninstall-from-cluster), but it ultimately is just a ```helm uninstall``` on the name of the application, plus the namespace as usual
```shell
helm uninstall apbs-rest --namespace apbs
```


#### All commands for easy Copy+Paste
- Minikube
    ```shell
    minikube addons enable ingress
    kubectl create namespace apbs
    helm install apbs-rest charts/apbs-rest \
    --namespace apbs \
    --set ingress.enabled=true,ingress.hosts[0]=apbs.$(minikube ip).xip.io
    ```
- Docker Desktop
    ```shell
    helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
    helm install nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system

    kubectl create namespace apbs
    helm install apbs-rest charts/apbs-rest \
    --namespace apbs \
    --set ingress.enabled=true,ingress.hosts[0]=apbs.127.0.0.1.xip.io
    ```


<hr/>

## Uninstall from Cluster
To uninstall the APBS-REST software from your local kubernetes cluster, simply type the following:
```
helm uninstall apbs-rest --namespace apbs
```
This will remove the release from your cluster **along with any associated storage volumes.  Make certain you download any output files you need from the cluster before removing APBS-REST from your local cluster.**

To uninstall the NGINX ingress controller we installed earlier, it's a similar command:
```
helm uninstall nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system
```

## For Developers

### Additional Install Requirements
Developers contributing to this repository will also need the following:
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)
    - for development on services using legacy [PDB2PQR code](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr/tree/master/pdb2pqr)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
    - Certain tests require this as they utilize the [Docker SDK for Python](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    
### Preface
This repository serves as the backend interface for an overhauled APBS web server.  As such, the code contained herein serves as **one of two** components necessary to develop on the website:
* [apbs-web](https://github.com/Eo300/apbs-web) (front-end)
  * After cloning to your desired location, use the ```npm run dev``` command to run a development server with the defined environment variables.
  * [**UPDATE**] With the move to Dockerize this component, building this frontend component is no longer needed as the build exists in it's own container
* [apbs-pdb2pqr](https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr)  
  * You will need to build APBS and PDB2PQR depending on which service you plan to develop for, as some use the legacy code via symlinks

For both of the above, feel free to clone them in a location of your choosing, though it's recommended to be done outside of this repository to avoid confusion with Git checking for file changes.

### Microservices

All the microservices live within the src directory. A list of all the services used within the Helm chart are as follows:
- [autofill](src/autofill)<sup>1</sup>
- [storage](src/storage)
- [task](src/task)
- [tesk-proxy](src/tesk)
- [uid](src/uid)
- [workflow](src/v2_workflow)

<sup>1</sup> Some services are dependent on legacy code from the original apbs-pdb2pqr repository.  Thus, you'd need to have a APBS/PDB2PQR build somewhere on your system and specific paths symlinked to the respective service.
